**Firefox Taskmaster**

A simple Firefox extension to run JS scripts on specific domains. There are others out there, probably with more features, but I can guarantee that this fabulous open source solution is not collecting any of your data or mining cryptocurrency in your browser.

Want to edit the UI of a crappy website that you find yourself having to use? Want to auto-fill forms that your browser won't for some stupid reason? Try the TaskMaster!
